Well, well, well. What do we have here? A new blog? Yup!

This is my umpteenth blog, however, this one is different! This one is about code. 

### What type of code?

I have no clue. Whatever strikes my fancy. Whatever interesting thing I learn. Something that needs sharing. And most likely, a stupid thing that took my hours to figure out.

### That's about it...

Hopefully if you are reading this, there are more posts to read. Go read them! And if not, then stay tuned!
