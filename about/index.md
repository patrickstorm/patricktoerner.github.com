My name is Patrick and I am a software developer. I got into building websites at an early age, and by the time I was 18 years old, I had around 15 different websites. I spent the majority of my free time building and promoting websites.

I continued this through college, amassing 50+ websites, until I heard about the New Venture Competition at UCSB. I found a great team at one of the mixers, and we began working on a mobile app for birdwatchers: Birdeez. This was when my passion for developing software began. We won the competition and got invited to the DEMO conference in San Jose, CA, where we were crowned DEMO Gods.

To further hone my programming skills and continue working on Birdeez, I got a job at a digital presence management startup called Local Market Launch. I was the sixth employee and slowly began picking up odd work in the tech department. Before long, I was given the title of Software Developer, and we have since expanded to over 60 employees. Local Market Launch has given me a wide array of training in many languages, architectures, APIs, and coding standards.

I absolutely love software development. It is one of the rare things in life that gets me into a state of flow, where time passes without even noticing. It's rare to find a career that truly makes one happy.
